# CUDA-Matrices
Homework Assignment 6 for CPSC 479 Spring 2022 taught by professor Doina Bein. Focuses on using CUDA to perform Matrix arithmetic.

Exercise 1. Write a CUDA program that includes a host function to compute the number of even values in a given NxN matrix, N being 8. 
Test your program on aries.ecs.fullerton.edu using the nvcc compiler to make sure it runs.

Exercise 2. Write a CUDA program that includes a host function to compute the square of a given NxN matrix, N being 8. For example, if the matrix given is A with 8x8 elements, the host function will compute the matrix AxA. Guide yourself using the slides from week 11, Google slide titled “ GPU Programming: Matrix Squaring (Version 1)” or “GPU: Programming Matrix Squaring (Version 2)”.
Test your program on aries.ecs.fullerton.edu using the nvcc compiler to make sure it runs.
